# ANA 620 – Continuous Data Methods & Applied Regression

**Author:** Randall C. Crawford

This repository contains coursework completed for **ANA 620**, a mathematically rigorous statistics course focused on the **theoretical foundations and applied practice of regression modeling**.

The course took a **deep dive into the mathematical underpinnings of statistical inference**, emphasizing *why* regression methods work, not just how to apply them. Topics were developed from first principles and reinforced through analytical derivations, simulations, and applied labs.

### Core areas of study included:

* Simple and multiple linear regression from a **probabilistic framework**
* Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation and its statistical properties
* Assumptions of regression models and their mathematical implications
* Error decomposition, variance estimation, and ANOVA for regression
* Hypothesis testing for regression coefficients (t-tests and F-tests)
* Confidence intervals for parameters and error variance
* Correlation, covariance, and sampling distributions
* Data transformations for variance stabilization and linearity
* Regression diagnostics, outliers, leverage, and influence
* Model selection using **Adjusted R², AIC, BIC, Mallows’ Cp**
* Dimensionality reduction and variable selection techniques

Hands-on work in **Python and R** complemented the theory, requiring reproducible analysis, diagnostic plots, and mathematical interpretation of results.

This repository reflects strong competency in **statistical theory, regression mathematics, and analytical reasoning**, forming a solid foundation for advanced analytics, data science, and machine learning work.
